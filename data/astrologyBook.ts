          "content": "The luminaries and planets are known to astronomers under the following names and symbols:—\n\nThe Sun ☉, Moon ☽, Neptune ♆, Uranus ♅, Saturn ♄, Jupiter ♃, Mars ♂, Venus ♀, and Mercury ☿.\n\nNeptune revolves around the Sun in its distant orbit once in about 165 years. Uranus completes its orbital revolution in 84 years, Jupiter in 12 years, Mars in about 15 months, Venus in 11 months, and Mercury in 18 weeks. From this it will be seen that the planets Neptune and Uranus are generational, so to speak, affecting great masses of people in the same way for years together. The planets Saturn and Jupiter are more individual in their effects, while Mars, Venus, Mercury and the Moon are quite personal in their influence. The natures of the planets are as follows:—\n\nNEPTUNE may be regarded as the hierophant of the solar system, and is related to all psychical and inspirational faculties. Its influence is subtle, magnetic, and spiritualising. It produces persons of a highly-strung and sensitive nature, whose minds are impressionable, and readily respond to subconscious and psychic influences.\n\nURANUS is the planet of the higher intellection, and is related to the study of occult science, astrology, mesmerism, and all subjects outside the common rut of thought. It produces originality, inventiveness, and a love of the marvellous and strange.\n\nSATURN represents the principle of condensation and crystallisation. Its nature is cold and contracting, producing deliberation, caution, and reserve. It gives a thoughtful and studious disposition, and inclines to all pursuits in which patience and plodding industry are required.\n\nJUPITER represents the principle of expansion. Its nature is generative and temperate, producing moderation, benevolence, and justice. It gives a generous, humane and cheerful disposition, and is related to all the higher moral and religious sentiments.\n\nMARS represents the principle of combustion and discord. Its nature is fiery, producing energy, courage and activity. It gives a confident and assertive disposition, is related to all the animal passions, and is very powerful in its effects for either good or evil.\n\nVENUS is the planet of love and cohesion. Its nature is warm and generative, producing harmony, affection and sociability. It gives a tender and sympathetic disposition, is related to all the higher social and artistic faculties, and contributes to the refinement of the nature.\n\nMERCURY is the planet of the intellect and nervous system. Its nature is excitable and restless. It is the messenger of the gods, and acts as an intermediary between the higher and lower natures.\n\nThe SUN is the centre of our solar system, and from it all life and energy are derived. It represents the vital principle in man. Its nature is fiery and life-giving.\n\nThe MOON is the planet of the instincts and feelings. Its nature is magnetic and receptive. It is the collector and reflector of the solar and planetary influences. It rules over all the functions and fluids of the body."

          "page": "24",
          "content": "The Zodiac is an imaginary belt of the Heavens through which the Sun and planets move in their apparent revolutions round the Earth. It is divided into twelve equal parts called Signs. Each sign contains 30 degrees of space. The names and symbols of the Signs are as follows:—\n\n1. Aries ♈\n2. Taurus ♉\n3. Gemini ♊\n4. Cancer ♋\n5. Leo ♌\n6. Virgo ♍\n7. Libra ♎\n8. Scorpio ♏\n9. Sagittarius ♐\n10. Capricornus ♑\n11. Aquarius ♒\n12. Pisces ♓\n\nThe Zodiac is divided into four sections corresponding to the four seasons of the year, and each section is composed of three signs. The Vernal or Spring quarter is composed of Aries, Taurus and Gemini. The Aestival or Summer quarter contains Cancer, Leo and Virgo. The Autumnal quarter is made up of Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius; and the Hibernal or Winter quarter is composed of Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces.\n\nThe signs are also divided according to their natures into four triplicities, representing the four elemental conditions called Fire, Earth, Air and Water. The Fiery triplicity is composed of Aries, Leo, Sagittarius. The Earthy triplicity of Taurus, Virgo, Capricornus. The Airy triplicity of Gemini, Libra, Aquarius. The Watery triplicity of Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.\n\nThere is a further division of the signs into three qualities, representing the three modes of action or expression, viz., Cardinal, Fixed and Common. The Cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricornus. The Fixed signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius. The Common signs are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces. Thus it will be seen that each of the elemental triplicities is represented by one of the three qualities mentioned."

          "chapter_title": "THE CELESTIAL HOUSES",
          "page": "29",
          "content": "The imaginary circle which passes immediately over your head as you face the South is called the Prime Vertical. Where this circle cuts the Eastern horizon is called the Ascendant. It is the beginning or cusp of the first House of the heavens. An equal division of the heavens into twelve parts, beginning from this point, gives the twelve Houses of the horoscope. Each of these Houses is related to a certain department of human life. The 1st House, called the Ascendant, has rule over the personality, the physical body, and the general constitution. The 2nd House relates to the finances, possessions, and worldly estate. The 3rd House governs the brethren, kindred, short journeys, writings and studies. The 4th House rules the parents, the home, and the end of life. The 5th House has to do with children, pleasures, and speculations. The 6th House is related to sickness, servants, and small animals. The 7th House, called the Descendant, has rule over marriage, partnerships, and public enemies. The 8th House governs death, legacies, and the partner's possessions. The 9th House is related to long voyages, dreams, and the higher mind. The 10th House, called the Mid-heaven, has rule over the honour, profession and reputation. The 11th House governs friends, hopes and wishes. The 12th House is related to sorrows, restrictions and secret enemies. The planets which may be in any of these Houses at the time of birth will have their influence upon that department of the life which is ruled by the particular House in question."

          "page": "31",
          "content": "Aspects are certain angular distances measured on the Ecliptic, and they form a fundamental part of astrological science. The principal aspects are as follows:—\n\nConjunction ☌ when two planets are in the same degree of the Zodiac.\nSextile ⚹ when two planets are 60 degrees apart.\nQuadrature or Square □ when two planets are 90 degrees apart.\nTrine △ when two planets are 120 degrees apart.\nOpposition ☍ when two planets are 180 degrees apart.\n\nThe Conjunction is variable in its effects, being fortunate or otherwise according to the nature of the planets concerned. The Sextile and Trine aspects are fortunate in their influence. The Square and Opposition are unfortunate. There are other aspects of minor importance, but these may be left out of account for all general purposes."
